# Traffic Simulator – FortiGate Administrator Labs

A lightweight **Ubuntu GUI traffic simulator** designed for **FortiGate Administrator (FortiOS 7.6)** training and hands-on security labs.

This tool generates **benign, controlled network traffic** that allows students and instructors to practice detection, visibility, and policy enforcement using Fortinet security features.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The Traffic Simulator is built for **defensive security education**, not offensive activity.

It helps demonstrate and validate:

- Antivirus (AV)
- Web Filtering
- Application Control
- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
- Indicators of Compromise (IOC / Threat Feeds)
- DoS policies and traffic shaping
- Logging and visibility in FortiGate and FortiAnalyzer

All traffic is generated using **simple HTTPS requests (`curl`)** and is intended **only for controlled lab environments**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🖥️ **Simple GUI (Tkinter)** – no browser or heavy frameworks
- 🎯 **Named targets** with expected FortiGuard category
- ✍️ **Editable target field** (select preset or type IP manually)
- 🔁 **One-shot or loop mode**
- 📜 **Live execution logs** inside the GUI
- 🔌 **Network interface selector**
- 📦 **Scenario import/export (JSON)**
- 🛡️ **Ethical guardrails** using allow-lists via configuration file
